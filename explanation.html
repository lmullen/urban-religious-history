  This is an interactive bibliography of books published about religious history in a particular American city. Its aim is to show where historians of American religion have focused their attention&mdash;and where they have not. You can read <a href="http://usreligion.blogspot.com/2015/10/a-bibliography-of-urban-american.html">Paul's account</a> of why we made this site and <a href="http://usreligion.blogspot.com/2015/10/what-map-of-urban-religious-histories.html">Lincoln's explanation</a> of what the map shows at the <i>Religion in American History</i> blog.
